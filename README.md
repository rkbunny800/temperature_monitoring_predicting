# temperature_monitoring_predicting

 This project demonstrates the implementation of an IoT-based environmental  monitoring system using the ESP8266 microcontroller and the BME280 sensor.

 The system measures temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in real time using I2C communication.

 The ESP8266 operates in Access Point (AP) mode, allowing users to connect directly via Wi-Fi without an external router(portable and no internet needed).

 A ML neural network is trained with temperature of four month ,to predict the temperature in the next hour
